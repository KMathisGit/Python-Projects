# Python-Projects
The following repository is a collective storage of my Python 3 projects.

## YellowPagesScrapper 
- Program uses the requests module as well as BeautifulSoup module.
- Web scrapping program that queries YellowPages for what the user is looking for. 
- User must input what it is they are looking for, a city, and a state. 
- Program will return a list of all the results back to the user listing each business and its information (Business name, Street Address, City, State, Zipcode, Phone).
- User may then save these results to a .csv file for further use (spreadsheet usage, database entry, etc.).

## PokemonListExample 
- Very simple program that demonstrates all of Python 3 list functions (Append, Extend, Pop, etc). 
- Program starts with 2 list of Pokemon (Johto starters & Canto starters) then the user can call list functions on the lists.

## TicTacToe
-Simple text version of the ever so popular board game TicTacToe.
